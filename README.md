# Dapr workshop .NET

The Dapr workshop is a workshop that teaches you how to apply [Dapr](https://dapr.io) to a microservices application. This repository contains the source-code that forms the starting point of the C# (.NET) version of the workshop. With each workshop assignment you will expand the application with a Dapr building block.  

**This branch contains the solution as it should be after assignment 2.**  

See the [Dapr workshop repository](https://github.com/edwinvw/dapr-workshop) for more information and instructions on how to get started.
